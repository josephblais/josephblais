Hi! I am a full stack web developer pivoting from 6 years of experience in freelance work in the arts. My highly developed aesthetic sensibility lends itself naturally to working with UX/UI. My previous experiences have honed my creativity, abstract thinking, time management, and client outreach. Having recently completed the Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp, I am excited to apply the broad range of skills I have acquired to my new-found passion for web development.
